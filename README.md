The provided sequence appears to outline a series of steps involving authentication procedures within a 5G network. The text seems to involve several components, such as the User Equipment (UE), the Security Edge Protection Function (SEAF), the Authentication Server Function (AUSF), the Access and Mobility Management Function (ARPF), and the Home Network (HN). These steps seem to describe the authentication and key agreement process within the 5G network. Below is a summarized interpretation of the steps:

1. The User Equipment (UE) sends the SUCI (Subscription Concealed Identifier) to the Security Edge Access Function (SEAF). The SUCI is the encrypted SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier) value, and the UE encrypts/decrypts the SUCI using pkHN.

2. The SEAF forwards the SUCI of the UE and the Service Name (SN) values to the Authentication Server Function (AUSF). The SN name consists of '5G' and 'SN id'.

3. The AUSF checks the SN list to authenticate the SN. After authentication, the AUSF sends the SUCI and SN names to the Access and Mobility Management Function (ARPF).

4. The ARPF authenticates the UE and verifies the authentication material and the AV (Authentication Vector).

5. The UE is authenticated by checking the UE list. The Sequence Number (SQN), Message Authentication Code (MAC), and Expected Response (XRES) are calculated for use in authentication. The MAC, XRES, CK, IK, and AK are calculated using f1-f5.

6. The 5G Home Environment Authentication Vector (5G HEAV) is the AV sent to the AUSF. It comprises the authentication material of the protocol.

7. The ARPF sends the 5G HEAV to the AUSF.

8. The AUSF can calculate HXRES*, KAUSF, and SUPI using 5G HEAV. The KAUSF is the key for calculating KSEAF.

9. The AUSF sends the KAUSF to the SEAF.

10. The AUSF sends 5G SEAV (Security Edge Authentication Vector) to the SEAF.

11. The SEAF calculates HXRES* and stores the value to authenticate the UE and HN.

12. The SEAF sends RAND (Random Number) and AUTN (Authentication Token) to the UE.

13. The UE calculates and compares the MAC to the XMAC and SQN. If the authentication fails, the UE sends a failure message to the SN. If successful, it calculates RES* and KSEAF using materials.

14. The UE sends the RES* to the SEAF.

15. The SEAF authenticates the UE and HN by comparing the HRES* to HXRES*.

16. The SN sends the RES* value to the HN.

17. Finally, the AUSF authenticates the UE by comparing the RES* and XRES* values. If authentication is successful, the AUSF sends the authentication result to the SN and ARPF.

18. The AUSF sends the authentication result to the ARPF and SN, and the KSEAF to SN.

This appears to be a detailed representation of the authentication and key agreement process within the 5G network, involving several entities and steps to ensure secure and authenticated communication between the User Equipment and the network.
